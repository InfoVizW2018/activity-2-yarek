## Activity #2

### Design:
See the "Activity 2 - Design" file.

### What:

A visualisation proposal for the SeaSpan vessel schedule. <br/>
DataSet type given: Table <br/>
Attribute types: <br/>
	- Categorical: Vessel names, destination names; <br/>
	- Ordered Quantitative Cyclic: Time. <br/>
### Why:

Provides a better visual overview of what vessels are going to what destination, with what load and at what given times. <br/>
This draft was designed with the SeaSpan employees in mind and probably the additional data it provides wouldn’t be very practical for the passengers themselves. <br/>
Actions: <br/>
	- Present: present the original data in a more visual way; <br/>
	- Derive: derive results from the original tables; <br/>
	- Lookup: should be easier to just look up the needed data, since the location and the targets are known. <br/>

### How:

Utilize the table concept with additional data represented by colours and symbols. <br/>
	- Order: order data by days of the week and time; <br/>
	- Colour: use colour to represent the different vessels; <br/>
	- Motion: show motion of the vessels to determine the direction of the trip. <br/>
  
### Pitfalls:

PF4: The data for the load is not available in the initial tables; <br/>
PF6: For users, it’s easier to just type in their destination rather than looking at the tables, so only might be useful for the stakeholders; <br/>
PF7: No previous experience in visualizing data; <br/>
PF9: The tables might be inconvenient to look at, but they still work and if data gets too big, the visualization might get a bit cluttered (e.g.: colours will blend); <br/>
PF20: Doesn’t give any information about the berths, putting them inside the vessel bars might pollute the visuals. <br/>
